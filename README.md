## Puzzule A* Pathfinding Project

# Description
This project implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze. The algorithm efficiently navigates through mazes filled with various obstacles, determining the optimal path from a start point to an end point. The A* algorithm is chosen for its balance between performance and accuracy, using a heuristic that estimates the cost from the current node to the goal, thus optimizing the pathfinding process.

# Features
- Efficient Pathfinding: Uses the A* algorithm with a heuristic to find the shortest path through the maze.
- Scalable to Large Mazes: Capable of handling mazes of varying sizes, demonstrating the algorithm's adaptability to different scenarios.
- Custom Node Class: Implements a custom Node class to manage the state and priority of each node during the search process.
